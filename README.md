## Introduction üìñ

This application leverages blockchain technology to track products throughout the supply chain while monitoring and recording the Co<sub>2</sub> emissions generated at each stage. By ensuring data integrity, transparency, and security, the system helps businesses and consumers make informed decisions regarding sustainability.

### Main Features

- *Product Tracking*: Monitors a product's journey from origin to final destination.

- *Co<sub>2</sub> Emissions Calculation*: Records emissions generated at each step of the supply chain.

- *Blockchain Integration*: Ensures data integrity and security using a private blockchain network.

- *Smart Contracts*: Automates verification and validation of product movement and emissions data.

- *Audit & Reporting*: Generates reports on Co<sub>2</sub> emissions for compliance and sustainability tracking.

### How it Works

The application begins with a home page where users can observe various companies and products, and check their provenance. Once authenticated, employers, carriers, and oracles can log in using secure methods. Employers can manage products within their organization, creating, updating, and viewing product details. Organizations can request products from others, and these requests are meticulously tracked and managed.

*Oracles* play a crucial role by facilitating coin transfers between organizations, ensuring smooth transactions. Every product movement and coin transfer is recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent ledger. The system also calculates and records CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for each product movement, helping organizations monitor their environmental footprint by giving or taking the coins they need for delivering their products.

### Technologies Used

The Supply-Chain application is built using the following technologies:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the main programming language
- [Hyperledger Besu](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/projects/besu) for the blockchain network
- [ConsenSys Tessera](https://docs.tessera.consensys.io/) for private transactions
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) for smart contract development
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/it/download/) for your private address and key
- [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for interacting with the smart contracts
- [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) for using a **WSGI** Server
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for containerization
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database

## Gettin Started üóÇÔ∏è

In order to run a local copy of the application, you need to follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- *Docker & Docker Compose* (Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) based on your OS)

In case the `quorum-test-network` folder does not work (there are many `.env` files inside it that cannot be uploaded in this repository), you can safely delete it and then run the following command:

```bash
npx quorum-dev-quickstart
```

You terminal will lool like this:

```bash
yourTerminal$ npx quorum-dev-quickstart

Welcome to the Quorum Developer Quickstart utility. This tool can be used
to rapidly generate local Quorum blockchain networks for development purposes
using tools like GoQuorum, Besu, and Tessera.

To get started, be sure that you have both Docker and Docker Compose
installed, then answer the following questions.

Which Ethereum client would you like to run? Default: [1]
        1. Hyperledger Besu
        2. GoQuorum
1
Do you wish to enable support for private transactions? [Y/n]
y
Do you wish to enable support for logging with Loki, Splunk or ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana)? Default: [1]
        1. Loki
        2. Splunk
        3. ELK
1
Do you wish to enable support for monitoring your network with Chainlens? [N/y]
N
Do you wish to enable support for monitoring your network with Blockscout? [N/y]
N
Where should we create the config files for this network? Please
choose either an empty directory, or a path to a new directory that does
not yet exist. Default: ./quorum-test-network

‚úÖ Installation complete.

To start your test network, run 'run.sh' in the directory, './quorum-test-network'
For more information on the test network, see 'README.md' in the directory, './quorum-test-network'
```
You will have to choose *1. Hyperledger Besu*, *y* for enabling Private Trnsactions, *1. Loki*, *n* for *Chainlens* and *Blockscout* and, finally, press *Enter* for creating the default directory *./quorum-test-network*

Then, you can safely build the images and run the containers using the following Docker command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Linux

The application has been tested and has been designed to run on Linux machines, and it is recommended to use a Linux distribution to run it.

More specifically, the application has been tested on these distributions:
- [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu-it.org/)
- [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/it/)
- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)

#### Windows

The application has been tested only on Windows 11, but it should work on Windows 10 too.

However, several problems may arise if you choose to run it on a Windows machine, especially, like said before, with the blockchain network.

To mitigate these issues, it is necessary to have **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) installed along with a Linux distribution and to have Docker configured to use WSL2 as the default engine. As mentioned earlier, we used Ubuntu to install and run the command `npx quorum-dev-quickstart`.

You can follow these steps to set up WSL and Ubuntu:

1. **Install WSL**:
    Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```

2. **Install Ubuntu**:
    After installing WSL, you can install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store or by running:
    ```powershell
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu
    ```

3. **Set up Ubuntu**:
    Once Ubuntu is installed, open the Ubuntu terminal and update the package list:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade 
    ```

    Install Node.js and npm:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
    ```

4. **Run the Quorum Dev Quickstart**:
    Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npx quorum-dev-quickstart
    ```

#### MacOS

The application has NOT been tested on macOS machines, neither on Intel nor ARM architectures.

Despite this, the application should still run on Mac, if the prerequisites are met.

## Usage üöÄ

Once the setup has been completed, the application is ready tu use. You just need to wait a few minutes to ensure that the blockchain starts up securely. Then, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command to observe the startup logs of the application and get the local address:

```bash
docker-compose logs flask-app 
```

Yor terminal will have an output that will look like this one:

```bash
PS ...\SoftwareSecurity-BlockchainProject> docker-compose logs flask-app
time="2025-02-03T18:21:36+01:00" level=warning msg="...\\SoftwareSecurity-BlockchainProject\\docker-compose.yaml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion"
